My code with github copilot
#Each one of these is a column title in the dataset
Data_set:
columns:
  - customer_id
  - customer_age

  - employment_duration
  - loan_intent
  - loan_grade
  - loan_amnt
  - loan_int_rate
  - term_years

# This was the data I imported from the website given to me by my teacher that even identified the unique columns

#This is the chatLog I had with github copilot: 
write code for the amount of columns 
#This wrote the section labeled columns: then proceeded to list all 12 columns
how many columns are there
#This proceeded to write the number of columns and gave me columns_count: 12 as in the total number of columns were 12.
how many total customers are there.
#This proceeded to count and generate the number 1000 that counted the total number of customers given the data above
